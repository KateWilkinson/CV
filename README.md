## Kate Wilkinson

Aspiring web developer. Passionate about solving tricky problems, good design and making stuff work.
Left a successful career in book publishing to pursue dream of working in a properly creative environment where I'm learning every day. Convinced that a career in coding will meet these criteria having completed an intensive web development course at Makers Academy where I was building something new and different every week and repeatedly told that I will never be able to learn all there is to know about code.
